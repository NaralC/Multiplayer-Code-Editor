Hey don't mind the fact that each connection comes with an extra socket ðŸ¥¶ (for now)

## You just cloned the project
### To get the frontend running:
1. cd client
2. npm i
3. npm run dev

### To get the backend running:
1. cd server
2. npm i 
3. npm start  

## Know Bugs
- Everyone joins with an unused duplicated socket
- Code doesn't automatically sync for late joiners
- If the host disconnects, the room dies
- Fast typing glitches out the code editor
