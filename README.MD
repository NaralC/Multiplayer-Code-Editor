## Know Bugs
- ~~Everyone joins with an unused duplicated socket~~
> The problem was in CodeMirrorEditor and EditorPage, there was no boolean key to prevent the duplicate pages in the code editor.
- ~~Code doesn't automatically sync for late joiners~~
> The problem was in CodeMirrorEditor, the onChangeCode sets to the default starting code - not the updated code.

- ~~If the host disconnects, the room dies~~
- More like: if there's only 1 player left and you refresh the page, the code is reset back to default. Normally if there are multiple people - the newly written code persists. Maybe bring we could store the code locally if there's a single player?
- ~~Fast typing~~ Pressing more than 1 key simultaneously glitches out the code editor
- Names that are too long messes up sidebar CSS

## Features To be Implemented
- ~~Language dropdown picker + Make current language sync with web sockets~~
- ~~Editor Theme dropdown picker + Make current theme sync with web sockets~~
- *Compilation with Judge0*
- ~~Make compiltation status sync with web sockets~~ 
- Implement cancellation with Axios if the compilation host quits
- New joiners are not notified if code's being compiled at the time
